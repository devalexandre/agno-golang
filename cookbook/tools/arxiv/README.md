# Arxiv Tool Example

This example demonstrates how to use the **ArxivTool** to build an academic research agent.

## Features
- Search Arxiv.org for academic papers
- Retrieve titles, authors, summaries, and PDF links
- Ideal for literature review and scientific research agents

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```

## How it works
The agent uses the `ArxivTool` to query the Arxiv API. It parses the XML response to extract relevant paper details and presents a summarized finding to the user.
