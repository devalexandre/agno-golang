# Wikipedia Tool Example

This example demonstrates how to use the **WikipediaTool** to give your agent access to the world's largest encyclopedia.

## Features
- Search Wikipedia for any topic
- Retrieve page summaries
- Seamless integration with Agno agents

## Usage

```bash
go run main.go
```

## How it works
The agent uses the `WikipediaTool` to search for terms extracted from the user's prompt. It then retrieves the summary of the most relevant page and uses that information to construct a comprehensive answer.
